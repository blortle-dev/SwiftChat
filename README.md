# SwiftChat
SwiftChat adds a menubar icon to your Mac, to give quick and easy access to ChatGPT with a click.

To make it run automatically on startup, manually add it via Apple > System Settings > General > Login Items > Click the +, then navigate to your Applications folder and select SwiftChat.

Tested and built on MacOS Sonoma (14.5), theoretically compatible with MacOS Big Sur (11.0) and later.

Known Issues:
- Menubar icon is only in white, needs a black icon for light mode.
